Description: Python Kinesis Producer Library Deaggregation Module
        ====================================================
        
        The `Amazon Kinesis Producer Library
        (KPL) <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-kpl.html>`__
        gives you the ability to write data to Amazon Kinesis with a highly
        efficient, asyncronous delivery model that can `improve
        performance <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-kpl.html#d0e4909>`__.
        When you write to the Producer, you can also elect to turn on
        Aggregation, which writes multiple producer events to a single Kinesis
        Record, aggregating lots of smaller events into a 1MB record. When you
        use Aggregation, the KPL serialises data to the Kinesis stream using
        `Google Protocol
        Buffers <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers>`__, and
        consumer applications must be able to deserialise this protobuf message.
        This module gives you the ability to process KPL serialised data using
        any Python consumer including `AWS
        Lambda <https://aws.amazon.com/lambda>`__.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The Python KPL Deaggregation module is available on the Python Package
        Index (PyPI) as
        `aws\_kpl\_deagg <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aws_kpl_deagg>`__. You
        can install it via the ``pip`` command line tool:
        
        ::
        
            pip install aws_kpl_deagg
        
        Alternately, you can simply copy the aws\_kpl\_deagg module from this
        repository and use it directly with the caveat that the `Google protobuf
        module <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/protobuf>`__ must also be available
        (if you install via ``pip``, this dependency will be handled for you).
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The Python KPL Deaggregation module provides a simple interface for
        working with KPL encoded data in a consumer application. The
        aws\_kpl\_deagg Python module provides for both bulk and generator-based
        processing.
        
        When using deaggregation, you provide a Kinesis Record, and get back
        multiple Kinesis User Records. If a Kinesis Record that is provided is
        not a KPL encoded message, that's perfectly fine - you'll just get a
        single record output from the single record input. A Kinesis User Record
        which is returned from the kpl-deagg looks like:
        
        ::
        
            {
                'eventVersion' : String - The version number of the Kinesis event used
                'eventID' : String - The unique ID of this Kinesis event
                'kinesis' :
                {
                    'partitionKey' : String - The Partition Key provided when the record was submitted
                    'explicitHashKey' : String - The hash value used to explicitly determine the shard the data record is assigned to by overriding the partition key hash (or None if absent) 
                    'data' : String - The original data transmitted by the producer (base64 encoded)
                    'kinesisSchemaVersion' : String - The version number of the Kinesis message schema used,
                    'sequenceNumber' : BigInt - The sequence number assigned to the record on submission to Kinesis
                    'subSequenceNumber' : Int - The sub-sequence number for the User Record in the aggregated record, if aggregation was in use by the producer
                    'aggregated' : Boolean - Always True for a user record extracted from a KPL aggregated record
                },
                'invokeIdentityArn' : String - The ARN of the IAM user used to invoke this Lambda function
                'eventName' : String - Always "aws:kinesis:record" for a Kinesis record
                'eventSourceARN' : String - The ARN of the source Kinesis stream
                'eventSource' : String - Always "aws:kinesis" for a Kinesis record
                'awsRegion' : String - The name of the source region for the event (e.g. "us-east-1")
            }
        
        To get started, include the ``aws_kpl_deagg`` module:
        
        ``import aws_kpl_deagg``
        
        Next, when you receive a Kinesis Record in your consumer application,
        you will extract the User Records using the deaggregations methods
        available in the ``aws_kpl_deagg`` module.
        
        **IMPORTANT**: The deaggregation methods available in the
        ``aws_kpl_deagg`` module expect input records in the same
        dictionary-based format they are normally received from AWS Lambda. See
        the `Programming Model for Authoring Lambda Functions in
        Python <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-programming-model.html>`__
        section of the AWS documentation for more details.
        
        Bulk Conversion
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The bulk conversion method of deaggregation takes in a list of Kinesis
        Records, extracts all the aggregated User Records and accumulates them
        into a list. Any records that are passed in to this method that are not
        KPL-aggregated records will be returned unchanged. The method returns a
        list of Kinesis User Records in the same format as they are normally
        delivered by Lambda's Kinesis event handler.
        
        ::
        
            user_records = deaggregate_records(raw_kinesis_records)
        
        Generator-based Conversion
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The generator-based conversion method of deaggregation uses a Python
        `generator function <https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators>`__ to
        extract User Records from a raw Kinesis Record one at a time in an
        iterative fashion. Any records that are passed in to this method that
        are not KPL-aggregated records will be returned unchanged. For example,
        you could use this code to iterate through each deaggregated record:
        
        ::
        
            for record in iter_deaggregate_records(raw_kinesis_records):        
                    
                #Process each record
                pass 
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        This module includes two example AWS Lambda function in the file
        `lambda\_function.py <src/lambda_function.py>`__, which gives you the
        ability to easily build new functions to process KPL encoded data.
        
        Bulk Conversion Example
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::

            from aws_kpl_deagg.deaggregator import deaggregate_records
            import base64
        
            def lambda_bulk_handler(event, context):
                
                raw_kinesis_records = event['Records']
                
                #Deaggregate all records in one call
                user_records = deaggregate_records(raw_kinesis_records)
                
                #Iterate through deaggregated records
                for record in user_records:        
                    
                    # Kinesis data in Python Lambdas is base64 encoded
                    payload = base64.b64decode(record['kinesis']['data'])
                    
                    #TODO: Process each record
                
                return 'Successfully processed {} records.'.format(len(user_records))

                record_count = 0
                
                #Deaggregate all records using a generator function
                for record in iter_deaggregate_records(raw_kinesis_records):   
                         
                    # Kinesis data in Python Lambdas is base64 encoded
                    payload = base64.b64decode(record['kinesis']['data'])
                   
                    #TODO: Process each record
                   
                    record_count += 1
                    
                return 'Successfully processed {} records.'.format(record_count)
