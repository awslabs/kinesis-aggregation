# Kinesis Record Aggregation & Deaggregation Modules for AWS Lambda

The Amazon Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) gives you the ability to write data to Amazon Kinesis with a highly efficient, asyncronous delivery model that can improve performance. The KPL is extremely powerful, but is currently only available as a Java API wrapper around a C++ executable which may not be suitable for all deployment environments. Similarly, the Kinesis Client Library (KCL) provides automatic deaggregation of KPL aggregated records, but not all Kinesis consumer applications, such as those running on AWS Lambda, are currently capable of leveraging this deaggregation capability.

_How the Kinesis Producer Library Publishes Data_

The components in this project give you the ability to process and create KPL compatible serialised data within AWS Lambda, in Java, Node.js and Python. These components can also be used as part of the Kinesis Client Library a [multi-lang KCL application](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/tree/v1.x/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/multilang). However, this project has several limitations:

* It only generates data, and doesn't perform delivery to the stream like the KPL. You still have to call PutRecord(s) to push data to Kinesis Data Streams
* It doesn't manage data across multiple streams like KPL - the interface assumes that all data is sent to a single Stream

## Aggregation

One of the main advantages of the KPL is its ability to use record aggregation to increase payload size and improve throughput. While this project is __not__ a replacement for the full KPL, it does provide you the ability to easily aggregate multiple user records into larger aggregated records that make more efficient use of available bandwidth and reduce cost. This data is encoded using Google Protocol Buffers, and returned to the calling function for subsequent use. You can then publish to Kinesis and the data is compatible with consumers using the KCL or these Deaggregation modules.

### Caution - you should only use Kinesis Aggregation outside of the Kinesis Producer Library for low-value messages where loss of a small number of messages is not critical. Aggregation results in messages being tagged to Shards, and in cases where the Stream is mutating during Aggregation, this can result in messages being rejected by the `PutRecords` API. [DATA LOSS CAN OCCUR.](potential_data_loss.md). Kinesis Deaggregation is compatible with all KPL published data and can be used safely. 

## Deaggregation

The components in this library allow you to efficiently deaggregate protocol buffer encoded aggregated records in any application, including AWS Lambda.

### Language Specific Implementations

AWS Lambda supports Java, Node.js, Python and Go as programming languages. We have included support for those languages so that you can create and process UserRecords via standalone modules. Documentation is provided for each language:

| Language | Location |
:--- | :--- 
| Java | [java](java/) |
| Node.js Javascript | [node.js](node/) |
| Python | [python](python/) |
| Go | [go](go/) |
